There are two ways of adding people in to the known_persons directory.
1. run add_persons.py and enter your name and then take your photo from webcam
2. else, directly copy your photo with filename <your-name>.jpg into known_persons directory


Once your photos are saved into known_persons directory, you can run the script face_recognition_webcam.py for face recognition
